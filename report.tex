\section{Introduction} 
The assignment was described on the course homepage
\cite{sensornetwork}. 

\subsection{General Design Considerations}
In object oriented software design, we aspire to build 
a model representation of the real world system \cite{roleplay}.  
Here the real world system is a sensor network as described in
Braginsky and Estrin \cite{braginsky2002}. Classes and their relations
and collaborations are supposed to coincide with those of the real
world entites, here in a sensor network. The realworld entities
modelled in this assignment can be classified in two groups: Physical
components such as the sensor nodes and information packages
travelling the network, such as the queries and agents. Further, is
also a third type, the environment entity which simulates the real
surrounding.



\textit{Unified Modelling Language}
(\textit{UML}) and \textit{Class Responsibility Collaborator}
(\textit{CRC}) diagrams were composed according to Börstler
\cite{roleplay}. The theory of rumour routing is described by Braginsky
\cite{braginsky2002}. Horstman was used as Java language reference
\cite{horstman2014}.

\section{Initialization and State Stepping}
\subsection{Overview}
First parameters that are needed to create nodes have to be determined.
That includes the position, and the probability to create agents after
an event happens. Then nodes can be created and
positioned. Afterwards, nodes have to be initialized to know their
neighbours. According to Braginsky and Estrin \cite{braginsky2002},
composing the neighbour list could happend either as an initial
startup phase, but if nodes are assumed non-static, also
continuous. Here nodes were assumed static. Finally, experimental
parameters for the environment need to be initialized. These are
parameters such as which nodes will create queries and in which
frequency. But also the probabilty of events and how the node to
experience them is selected. 

Setup/Main instantiates the Environment, then instantiates the Nodes
with coordinates and places them in the environment. On
instantiation, the probability for agent creation is set as attribut
in each node.

In each time step, the environment cycles twice through all
nodes. First random generation of an event, then to handle the messages
(agents and queries). Messages are put in a queue in the node. If
a node has either sent, received, or instantiated a new message, a
busy flag is set, so that no other operation from outside
can be accepted.
